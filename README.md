## About Cable cutting optimization
Cable is a valuable and expensive material in EPC projects. Saving cable not only cause less cost but also speed up the project. In many projects, a large amount of unusable cable is left after completion. These wasted materials could be used in other projects and enhanced the company performance. 



## Requirements
- Python
- pyomo (library)
- Solver (software)



## How works
- Define general variables
- Run project


## Todo
- Change the optimization function to speed up solving
- Design GUI
